Sure, you can play in any cut or profile as long as the edges are sharp and even and the finish is smooth. However, if the specs don’t agree with you, it’ll be difficult to reach your highest potential.<br><br> \n\nSharpening is measured on a scale.

The runners will look and feel a bit different, but many who switch greatly enjoy the change. It is simple to try, and if you want to switch back, that’s also pretty straightforward.
